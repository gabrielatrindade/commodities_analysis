- [commodities_EDA](https://github.com/gabrielatrindade/commodities_analysis/blob/master/commodities_EDA.ipynb): 
Exploratory Data Analysis of `All_Commodities` dataset. 
Here I explore how the data is organized - what each row represents, columns and their values meaning - with the help from FAQ's and Reference Data from the website. 
I also picked up the 5 commodities I want to work on - which are 'Coffee, Green', 'Grapefruit, Fresh', 'Lemons/Limes, Fresh', 'Oranges, Fresh', and 'Tangerines/Mandarins, Fresh'. \
*Besides pandas library I used `pandas_profiling` to have an overview of each column.

- [5_commodities_visualization](https://github.com/gabrielatrindade/commodities_analysis/blob/master/5_commodities_visualization.ipynb): 
Getting information from 5 commodities, using visualization. Some graphs are plotted here for the following questions: \
              1. Largest producers / consumers per commodity \
              2. Balance between production and consumption in respective origin countries \
              3. Percentage of consumption of commodity for the largest producers \
              4. Stock level balance throughout the years \
              5. Top 7 Exporters per Commodity in a year

   I used Pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries.
